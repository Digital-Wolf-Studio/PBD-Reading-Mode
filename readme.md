# PBD Reading Mode

This is a simple WordPress plugin which uses the awesome [Colorbox](http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox) jQuery plugin by [Jack Moore](https://twitter.com/jacklmoore).

It adds a link to the beginning of each of your posts when viewed on its individual post page. Clicking the link loads a totally clutter-free popup with just the post's content and some nice typography.

Click the "Reading Mode" link in the [demo site here](http://www.problogdesign.com/demo/reading-mode/2012/07/24/click-through-to-single-post-view/) to see it in action.

To understand how it works, or to integrate it into your theme without a plugin, [check out the tutorial](http://www.problogdesign.com/wordpress/how-to-add-a-reading-mode-to-your-posts/).
